<span id="paraphrase_content" style="display:none">
The overall message of the poem is one outlining the "requirements" that the narrator believes are necessary to be a Man. These requirements are mostly psychological, and they are presented in a long, rambling list. <br/>
My son, to mature into a Man, you'll need to make sure you fit these descriptions: <br/>
A Man is confident in himself, patient, and level-headed. <br/>
A Man must be able to balance his wildest dreams and his rational mind. <br/>
He must be driven yet avoid getting hung up on his aspirations.<br/>
He must be strong in the face of defeat or loss, no matter how severe. <br/>
Finally, to become a Man, you must never forget your origins. Don't ever forget your friends or where you came from. IF you can do all this, son, you'll be a Man.

<span id="keyPhrases_content" style="display:none">
  <h1>if...</h1>
The word "if" opens nearly every other line of the poem, and is also the title of the piece itself.  The literal definition of "if" is a phrase used to express uncertainty about the future. In this poem, Kipling uses "if" to enhance the narrator's storytelling perspective as a father showing his son what constitutes a real Man.  The word also helps to establish the idea of masculinity as a distant goal, and one that should be chased after by his son. 
  <h1>Man</h1>
Though this word only appears once in the entire poem, "Man"  represents an important theme of the poem, masculinity.  The narrator lists out to his son all the defining attributes of a Man, and tells his son that when he accomplishes these feats, he too will be a real Man. The capitalizing of the word is significant because the author chooses to use it as a proper noun-- meaning that "man" is not an arbitrary characteristic, but rather a n honor given to a select group of people. This helps enhance Kipling's and the narrator's message that being a Man  should be treated like a badge of honor because of all the difficulties that come with keeping up the façade of strength and fortitude.

<ul>
<li>Kipling organizes his poem If- as a list of responses to many scenarios.</li> 
<li>To be a man, the narrator insists that his son must fulfill all of these listed requirements.</li>
<li>The overall effect of this listing is that it almost adds a layer of satire of ridicule to the narrator's idea of masculinity. By listing so many different requirements, it makes the narrator seem to either have a very surface-level view of masculinity or to be sarcastically listing off what society at the time deemed necessary to be considered a "man". </li>
<li>The poem is divided into stanzas based on different themes: having self-confidence, staying grounded in reality, being resilient, and being humble and personable. This method of organization lends itself to easily understanding the various aspects of psychological identity of a man, and what challenges the narrator believes one must overcome or be ready for as a man.</li>
</ul>

<span id="litDevices" align = 'center' class = "highlighted_text"> [lit. devices] </span>
<span id="litDevices_content" style="display:none">
  <h1>Parallelism</h1>
 Every other line begins with "If you can..." The usage of this anaphora is used to illustrate the long list of demands that the narrator believes is necessary for his son to become a man. In having this constant repetition, it also adds a sense of ridicule to the whole idea of masculinity presented in this poem. Another way to look at this is that the social norm or concept for masculinity is very archaic and does not really account for happiness or satisfaction in any way, and perhaps the narrator is trying to highlight the shortcomings of these perceptions in a sarcastic manner to his son.
  <h1><br />Juxtaposition</h1>
When the narrator discusses the traits of masculinity, especially in stanzas 1, 2, and 4, Kipling often juxtaposes contrary ideas or situations to show how the narrator believes a man should be a versatile master of many social and psychological situations. In the first stanza, Kipling juxtaposes one's self-esteem with the views or accusations of others around you, conveying the importance of self-confidence for a man. This idea that men should be kind of a rock was fairly popular around the time that the poem was written, in 1943 due to the ongoing World War, where the soldiers were thought to embody the ideal of masculinity. The second stanza juxtaposes being grounded in thought with ambition, and the fourth juxtaposes success and staying connected with your old friends. These last two uses of juxtaposition further contribute to the overall message of the author that this idea of masculinity presented in the poem requires versatility and can almost seem overwhelming with all the things that a real man must keep in mind.

<span id="connections_content" style="display:none">
After reading and doing a bit of research on this poem and its significance, especially that a line from it is prominently dispayed on Centre Court at Winbledon, I drew a connection to last year's mens' singles final, and especially the experience of Novak Djokovic. being a big pro tennis fan, I watched the entire epic 5-hour 2019 final between Novak Djokovic and Roger Federer. <br />
This poem is especially relevant in the context of this match: it was a tight final, with Federer eventually going up to have 2 match points in the deciding set. Djokovic needed to take a huge risk in order to save the points and get back in the match. Furthermore, the result of this match between two of the greatest players of all time could have a huge impact on who would be considered the absolute greatest. Just like in the poem, Djokovic needed to risk "a heap of all [his] winnnings, and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss," which in this case were each of the two upcoming points. <br />
In the broader context of the two players' careers, much of the struggles that the narrator in "If-" highlights are relevant to the Wimbledon final. Federer as a player and personality is much more beloved than Djokovic, and many fans go as far as to actively despise Djokovic for his erratic on-court behavior. (If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you...Or being hated, don't give way to hating,") <br />
Facing the two match points, the tense silence in the crowd was almost deafening, and I found myself holding my breath as well. As a player myself, I could relate to the tension of being match point down, as well as the self-doubt and nerves that come with the situation. As I watched, Federer missed an easy forehand. The crowd exploded into gasps and cheers. Onto the next match point. Federer drew Djokovic wide with a strong forehand approach, and the crowd held its breath. This could be the shot that sealed it. But Djokovic stetched to reach the ball, and came up with an approach that almost caught the outside line. It was a jaw-dropping shot, and possibly the best shot under pressure ever. <br />
Djokovic's actions under pressure in this final, I believe, epitomize the values that the narrator conveys in "If-." Being booed by the crowd, he was under immense pressure. But he managed to keep his cool and his will to win, pulling off amazing saves to eventually win the final. I believe that this is the virtue that the narrator preaches about-- being mentally strong, no matter the circumstances.

<span id="research" align = 'center' class = "highlighted_text"> [research] </span>
<span id="research_content" style="display:none">
From reading other analyses of the poem, I think that I missed out on a motivational tone that many other readers noticed or caught on. In fact, I even learned that the poem is considered to be so inspiring that a quote from it is displayed prominently on the Wimbledon Centre Court: "If you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same..." I can definitely see how this poem could be considered inspirational, since it does advise the young man how to act in the face of defeat or in the face of a challenge. I think that I interpreted it differently because I saw the narrator's directed speech as more patronizing than warm, though the ending phrases do, in hindsight, convey a very familial and helpful attitude. <br /> <br />
Some readers of the poem also mentioned that this poem could be thought about as a pep talk to inspire the narrator or even Kipling himself to be a virtuous and strong person, which is a very interesting take. I did not think of this perspective in my initial readings, and no I think that "If-" could very well serve as a motivational poem, whether it was written for outside readers or just for the author himself. <br /> <br />
Rudyard Kipling was born in India in 1865. At the age of five, his parents sent him back to England for education, where he proved to be a troublesome child. In adulthood, he was renowned for his literary talents, winning the 1907 Nobel Prize for literature, and writing the iconic Jungle Book. However, his political views drew much criticism, as critics call him a colonialist, racist, and warmonger. It is somewhat ironic, then, that one of his most recognizable poems, "If", talks about the attributes of a virtuous man. <br /> <br />

Through the process of analyzing the poem and researching the context behind it, I found this poem to be very relatable and inpiring. I do have slightly mixed emotions on the messaage of the text, especially regarding to which context the poem is being quoted in. If the poem is being referenced in the context of sports, I think that "If-" is incredibly inspiring and relevant in regards to the mental fortitude required to excel athletically. However, if it is used as a commentary on society, I feel like it might be troublesome, because it reinforces archaic gender roles and stereotypes. But, many of the core messages, such as confidence and humility, still are important to hold to heart regardless of context.

In my opinion, this poem is overall very effective, due to the relatable subject matter as mentioned above and also how eaily it lends itself to comprehension. The simple vocabulary used throughout the poem effectively conveys Kipling's messages of virtue, and the short phrasing and elementary syntax divide the poem into easy understandable, bite-size thoughts. Kipling's "If-" is a masterful poem because of its simple yet compelling organization, which effectively conveys the attributes of a respectable man.
